# Introduction to Interactive Graphics and *Plotly Dash*!

In this tutorial, I will explain the different types of graphics and the benefits of interactive graphical libraries. I will particularly focus on the interactive properties of **Plotly** and the reactive dashboard capabilities of **Dash**.

Although I won't spend much time on the syntax of building an interactive dashboard in **Dash**, I hope this tutorial will demonstrate the importance and the potential of these great libraries, and peak in interest in exploring them further.
